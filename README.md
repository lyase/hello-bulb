as of october 2015
I think  master branch is broken  with
device:  device_plan.pro
firmware: /home/ubsafder/work/hello-bulb/firmware/usbtiny-1.7/usb-device-standalone-firmware/

so i am making a new branch now based on the work https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/prjdetail.php?pid=0
the new board is power-switch.pro
and the firmware are found in /PowerSwitchobdev/
to be tested in real world
